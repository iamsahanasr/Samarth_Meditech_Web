Before we start, you need to start a new python interpreter session. Python interpreter is a software which can intrepret and run python programs. It runs through your python program line-by-line executing each one at a time. Thus you can either open up an interactive interpreter session and try out python instructions one at a time or feed your entire python program as input to the interpreter. We will be working in the interactive interpreter in this chapter. 

### Starting interactive interpreter
#### Linux:
> $python3 [enter]
 
#### Windows:
* install python3 
* open IDLE ide and launch interpreter or in the command line enter python followed by enter key
