In python it is compulsory to indent code because the indentation level decides to which block the statement belongs. There are no braces like { } to define the scope. Here is an example:
```
statement_1
  statement_1_1
  statement_1_2
  statement_1_3
    statement_1_3_1
    statement_1_3_2
  statement_1_4
  ```
  In the above example statement_1_1 belongs to the block statement_1. statement_1_3_1 belongs to statement_1_3 block. If you know any of the conventional languages like C,Java you will realize that indentation level does the task of braces. This will become clearer as you code more. 
  
Due to this rule, python programs are readable by default!! Adding to the humane nature of the language.

**Note: You should mix spaces and tabs to give indentation. It is better to make use of an editor like sublime text, atom, notepad++ etc. which does the indentation for you**
